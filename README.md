# so_long
so_long is a small minigame in which a character must collect all the objects, in my case chests, and then get out of the room through an exit. The subject is <a href="https://github.com/rphlr/42-Subjects/blob/main/common-core/so_long/en.subject.pdf">here</a> and it must also include a folder called "utils" with all my previous projects and MLX42 which is <a href="https://github.com/codam-coding-college/MLX42">here</a>. The graphics I chose for this project are actually a reference to a <a href="https://x.com/ThatSquirrelly/status/1681084258931146753">Digimon fanart</a> which was itself a reference to Pok√©mon Mystery Dungeon Explorers of Darkness.
This project was validated on 19th April 2024 after 4 retries.

<h3>Things to improve:</h3>
Sometimes the map may fail to load despite being correct; it might have to do with a memory problem which was not detected by fsanitize and I could not fix. It also has unused graphics (Demidevimon sprites) intended for the bonus parts which I did finally not do.
